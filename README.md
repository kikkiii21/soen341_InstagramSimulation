# soen341_InstagramSimulation

## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to simulate a software development process through the creation of a simplified version of Instagram. The project will be completed in 4 sprints each lasting about 2-3 weeks.

## Description 
Social media applications allow their users the benefit and convenience of staying in touch with friends and family by overcoming the barriers of distance and travel. To offer these benefits, this project's web application will feature four core elements implemented with specific frameworks and programming languages. In summary, registered users will have the power to:
- Post a picture with text description on their page
- Follow another user to receive notifications when the other user creates picture posts
- Leave comments to a posted picture
- (TBD)
